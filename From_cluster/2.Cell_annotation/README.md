# Cell type annotation using label transfer from snRNA.

  * Integrate snRNA and snATAC objects, should be paired ideally.

  * Transfer cell type annotation labels from snRNA to snATAC.

    + Can transfer any labels by this method, used in tumor heterogeneity analysis for snRNA clusters label transfers.
