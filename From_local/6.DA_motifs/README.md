# Analyses related to TF motif scores.

## Analyses:

1. ```For_cell_of_origin.20210721``` -- Analysis of motifs using clustering of PT cells.

  * Correlation heatmap.

  * PCA plot.

  * Analysis of pseudotime trajectories using Monocle3.


2. ```Tumor_vsPT.20210715``` -- Motifs consistenly UP/DOWN across all tumor samples.

  * Comparisons are made for tumor cells from each sample vs PT cells pooled from 4 NAT samples.
